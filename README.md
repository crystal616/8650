Reproduce the results of paper "Scalable k-Means Clustering via Lightweight Coresets", Olivier Bachem, Mario Lucic, Andreas Krause. KDD 2018, August 19-23, 2018, London, United Kingdom.

Four datasets are analyzed in this study.
1)	KDD — 145’751 samples with 74 features measuring the match between a protein and a native sequence [3].
2)	CSN — 7GB of cellphone accelerometer data processed into 80’000 observations and 17 features [4].
3)	SONG — 90 features from 515’345 songs of the Million Song datasets used for predicting the year of songs [5].
4)	RNA — 8 features from 488’565 RNA input sequence pairs [6].
